🎥 Lights, Camera, Recommendations! 🍿 During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on a Movie Recommendation System that suggests films based on user preferences. It's been an exciting journey into the world of recommendation algorithms. Thank you, CodSoft, for the opportunity to intern with such a dynamic and innovative company. I've gained invaluable skills and insights during my time here. #CodSoft #RecommendationSystem
