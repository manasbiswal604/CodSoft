🤖 Exciting Opportunity with #CodSoft! 🚀

Thrilled to share my implementation of a simple chatbot using Python! 🐍 This code utilizes regular expressions and pattern matching techniques to recognize user inputs and respond based on predefined rules. From greetings to jokes and assistance queries, the bot engages with users dynamically. The script also features a user-friendly loop for interactive conversations. Thanks to #CodSoft for the chance to showcase this coding adventure! 🙌 #Chatbot #PythonProgramming #CodeSnippet #AI
